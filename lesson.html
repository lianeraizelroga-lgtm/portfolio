                <br>
                <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
                <p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Discuss the history that led to the creation of computer science as a field</li>
                    <li>Define computer science</li>
                    <li>Assess what computer science can do, as well as what it should not do</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <p>The field of computer science (CS) is the study of computing, which includes all phenomena related to computers, such as the Internet. With foundations in engineering and mathematics, computer science focuses on studying algorithms. An algorithm is a sequence of precise instructions that enables computing. This includes components computers use to process information. By studying and applying algorithms, computer science creates applications and solutions that impact all areas of society. For example, computer science developed the programs that enable online shopping, texting with friends, streaming music, and other technological processes.</p>
                <p>While computers are common today, they weren't always this pervasive. For those whose lives have been shaped by computer technology, it can sometimes seem like computer technology is ahistorical: computing often focuses on rapid innovation and improvement, wasting no time looking back and reflecting on the past. Yet the foundations of computer science defined over 50, and as much as 100, years ago very much shape what is possible with computing today.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>The Early History of Computing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first computing devices were not at all like the computers we know today. They were physical calculation devices such as the abacus, which first appeared in many societies across the world thousands of years ago. They allowed people to tally, count, or add numbers (Figure 1.2). Today, abaci are still used in some situations, such as helping small children learn basic arithmetic, keeping score in games, and as a calculating tool for people with visual impairments. However, abaci are not common today because of the invention of number systems such as the Arabic number system (0, 1, 2, 3, . . .), which included zero and place values that cannot be computed with abaci. The concept of an algorithm was also invented around this time. Algorithms use inputs and a finite number of steps to carry out arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and produce outputs used in computing. Today’s computers still rely on the same foundations of numbers, calculations, and algorithms, except at the scale of billions of numbers and billions of calculations per second.</li>
                    <li>To introduce a concrete example of an algorithm, let us consider binary search algorithm, which is used to locate a number in a sorted array of integers efficiently. The algorithm operates by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half to perform the search. If the number being searched is less than the integer in the middle of the interval, the interval is narrowed to the lower half. In the alternative, the interval is narrowed to the upper half. The algorithm repeatedly checks until the number is found or the interval is empty.</li>
                    <li>Algorithms may sound complicated, but they can be quite simple. For example, recipes to prepare food are algorithms with precise directions for ingredient amounts, the process to combine these, and the temperatures and cooking methods needed to transform the combined ingredients into a specific dish. The dish is the output produced by following the algorithm of a recipe.</li>
                </ul>

                </div>

                <ul>
                    <li>The next major development in the evolution of computing occurred in 1614 when John Napier, a Scottish mathematician, developed logarithms, which express exponents by denoting the power that a number must be raised to obtain another value. Logarithms provided a shortcut for making tedious calculations and became the foundation for multiple analog calculating machines invented during the 1600s.</li>

                    <li>Scientists continued to explore different ways to speed up or automate calculations. In the 1820s, English mathematician Charles Babbage invented the Difference Engine with the goal of preventing human errors in manual calculations. The Difference Engine provided a means to automate the calculations of polynomial functions and astronomical calculations.</li>

                    <li>Babbage followed the Difference Engine with his invention of the Analytical Engine. With assistance from Ada Lovelace, the Analytical Engine was program-controlled and included features like an integrated memory and an arithmetic logic unit. Lovelace used punched cards to create sequencing instructions that could be read by the Analytical Engine to automatically perform any calculation included in the programming code. With her work on the Analytical Engine, Lovelace became the world’s first computer programmer.</li>

                    <li>The next major development in computing occurred in the late 1800s when Herman Hollerith, an employee of the U.S. Census Office, developed a machine that could punch cards and count them. In 1890, Hollerith’s invention was used to tabulate and prepare statistics for the U.S. census.</li>

                    <li>By the end of the 1800s and leading into the early 1900s, calculators, adding machines, typewriters, and related machines became more commonplace, setting the stage for the invention of the computer. In the 1940s, multiple computers became available, including IBM’s Harvard Mark 1. These were the forerunners to the advent of the digital computer in the 1950s, which changed everything and evolved into the computers and related technology we have today.</li>

                    <li>Around this time, computer science emerged as an academic discipline rooted in the principles of mathematics, situated primarily in elite institutions, and funded by demand from the military for use in missile guidance systems, airplanes, and other military applications. As computers could execute programs faster than humans, computer science replaced human-powered calculation with computer-powered problem-solving methods. In this way, the earliest academic computer scientists envisioned computer science as a discipline that was far more intellectual and cognitive compared to the manual calculation work that preceded it.</li>

                    <li>Richard Bellman was a significant contributor to this effort. A mathematics professor at Princeton and later at Stanford in the 1940s, Bellman later went to work for the Rand Corporation, where he studied the theory of multistage decision processes. In 1953, Bellman invented dynamic programming,1 which is a mathematical optimization methodology and a technique for computer programming. With dynamic programming, complex problems are divided into more manageable subproblems. Each subproblem is solved, and the results are stored, ultimately resulting in a solution to the overall complex problem.2 With this approach, Bellman helped revolutionize computer programming and enable computer science to become a robust field.</li>

            <section class="layout">
                <h3 id="l2B">Computing and Formal Science</h3>
                <p>Formal science encompasses disciplines that study abstract structures, logical systems, and mathematical relationships rather than empirical phenomena. Unlike natural sciences that investigate the physical world or social sciences that examine human behavior, formal sciences focus on formal systems defined by axioms, rules, and logical operations. The primary formal sciences include mathematics, logic, statistics, theoretical computer science, and systems theory.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>First Principles Foundation</h3>
                <p>Starting from first principles, formal science rests on several fundamental concepts. The foundation begins with the notion of abstraction—the process of isolating essential properties while removing irrelevant details. From this abstraction emerges the concept of formal systems, which consist of a set of symbols, rules for manipulating these symbols, and axioms that serve as starting points for logical reasoning.</p>
                <p>The core principle underlying all formal science is the idea that truth can be established through logical deduction from accepted premises. This differs fundamentally from empirical sciences, where truth is established through observation and experimentation. In formal science, once axioms are accepted and rules are established, conclusions follow necessarily through logical reasoning.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Essential Characteristics</h3>
                <p>Formal sciences possess several defining characteristics that distinguish them from other branches of knowledge. They operate with precise definitions and unambiguous terms, ensuring that concepts have exact meanings within their contexts. They employ rigorous logical reasoning, where each step in an argument follows necessarily from previous steps according to established rules. They maintain consistency, meaning that contradictory statements cannot both be true within the same system.</p>
                <p>These disciplines also demonstrate completeness in their ideal form, where every true statement within the system can be proven using the system's rules and axioms. They exhibit universality, as their truths hold across all possible contexts that satisfy the system’s conditions, independent of time, place, or specific circumstances.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Relationship to Other Sciences</h3>
                <p>Formal sciences serve as the foundational language and toolset for other scientific disciplines. Natural sciences rely on mathematics for measurement, modeling, and theoretical formulation. Social sciences use statistics for data analysis and logical frameworks for theoretical development. Applied sciences employ formal methods for engineering design and technological innovation.</p>
                <p>This relationship demonstrates that formal sciences provide the structural backbone that enables other sciences to formulate precise theories, make quantitative predictions, and test hypotheses rigorously. Without formal science, other disciplines would lack the precision and logical rigor necessary for scientific advancement.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Practical Applications and Significance</h3>
                <p>The importance of formal science extends beyond theoretical considerations into practical applications that shape modern society. Computer science relies on formal logic and mathematical structures to design algorithms and software systems. Engineering disciplines use mathematical models to design safe and efficient structures. Economic theory employs mathematical frameworks to understand market behavior and optimize resource allocation.</p>
                <p>Formal science thus represents humanity's systematic approach to understanding abstract relationships and logical structures. By starting with basic principles of abstraction and logical reasoning, formal sciences create the intellectual tools that enable precise thinking and problem-solving across all domains of human knowledge and activity.</p>
                <br>

            </section>

            <section class="layout">
                <h3 id="l2C">Computing and Natural Science</h3>
                <p>Natural science represents the systematic study of the natural world through observation, experimentation, and the formulation of testable explanations. At its core, natural science seeks to understand how the universe operates by identifying patterns, establishing cause-and-effect relationships, and developing theories that can predict future phenomena.</p>
                <br>
                
                <h3>Foundational Principles</h3>
                <p>Natural science rests on several fundamental assumptions that form its conceptual foundation. The first principle holds that the natural world operates according to consistent, discoverable laws. This means that similar conditions will produce similar results, allowing scientists to identify reliable patterns in nature. The second principle assumes that human senses and instruments can provide accurate information about the world, though this information must be verified through rigorous testing.</p>
                <p>The third foundational principle establishes that natural phenomena have natural explanations. Rather than attributing events to supernatural causes, natural science seeks explanations within the framework of physical, chemical, and biological processes. This principle drives scientists to look for mechanisms that can account for observed phenomena through natural laws and processes.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>The Scientific Method as Core Framework</h3>
                <p>The scientific method provides the operational framework for natural science. This systematic approach begins with careful observation of natural phenomena, followed by the formation of hypotheses that offer potential explanations. Scientists then design controlled experiments to test these hypotheses, collecting data that either supports or refutes their proposed explanations.</p>
                <p>This process incorporates crucial elements of reproducibility and peer review. Other scientists must be able to replicate experiments and obtain similar results, ensuring that findings represent genuine discoveries rather than isolated occurrences or experimental errors. The requirement for peer review adds another layer of verification, as experts in relevant fields evaluate the methodology, analysis, and conclusions before accepting new findings.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Major Branches and Their Interconnections</h3>
                <p>Natural science encompasses several major disciplines, each focusing on different aspects of the natural world while sharing common methodological approaches. Physics examines the fundamental properties of matter and energy, establishing the basic laws that govern all natural phenomena. Chemistry builds upon physical principles to understand how atoms and molecules interact, combine, and transform.</p>
                <p>Biology applies both physical and chemical principles to understand living systems, from individual cells to complex ecosystems. Earth sciences integrate concepts from physics, chemistry, and biology to comprehend planetary processes and the history of our planet. Each discipline contributes unique perspectives while drawing upon insights from the others, creating a comprehensive understanding of natural phenomena.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Evidence-Based Knowledge Building</h3>
                <p>Natural science advances through the systematic accumulation of evidence-based knowledge. Scientific theories represent well-substantiated explanations supported by extensive experimental evidence and capable of making accurate predictions. These theories undergo continuous refinement as new evidence emerges, demonstrating the self-correcting nature of scientific inquiry.</p>
                <p>The process distinguishes between correlation and causation, recognizing that simultaneous occurrence of events does not necessarily indicate a causal relationship. Scientists employ controlled experiments and statistical analysis to establish genuine causal connections, building reliable knowledge about how natural systems function.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Quantitative Analysis and Mathematical Modeling</h3>
                <p>Mathematics serves as the language of natural science, providing tools for precise measurement, statistical analysis, and theoretical modeling. Quantitative approaches allow scientists to identify subtle patterns, test theories with precision, and make accurate predictions about future phenomena.</p>
                <p>Mathematical models help scientists understand complex systems by representing key relationships and variables in simplified forms. These models can reveal underlying principles that might not be apparent through observation alone, enabling deeper insights into natural processes.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Predictive Power and Practical Applications</h3>
                <p>The ultimate test of scientific understanding lies in its predictive power and practical applications. Successful scientific theories not only explain existing observations but also accurately predict the outcomes of new experiments and the behavior of natural systems under different conditions.</p>
                <p>This predictive capability enables the development of technologies that harness natural phenomena for human benefit, from medical treatments based on biological understanding to engineering applications grounded in physical principles. The practical success of these applications provides strong validation for the underlying scientific theories.</p>
                <p>Natural science thus represents humanity's most reliable method for understanding the natural world, built upon systematic observation, rigorous experimentation, and continuous refinement of knowledge through evidence-based inquiry. Its strength lies in its commitment to testing ideas against reality and its willingness to revise understanding when new evidence demands it.</p>
                <br>

            </section>

            <section class="layout">
                <h3 id="l2D">Computing and Social Science</h3>
                <p>Social science represents the systematic study of human behavior, relationships, and societies using empirical methods and theoretical frameworks. To understand this field through first principles, we must begin with its fundamental components and build upward.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>The Foundation: What Constitutes Social Science</h3>
                <p>Social science emerges from a basic premise: human behavior follows patterns that can be observed, measured, and analyzed. Unlike natural sciences that study physical phenomena, social science examines the complex interactions between individuals, groups, and institutions. The field encompasses disciplines such as sociology, psychology, economics, political science, anthropology, and geography.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Core Assumptions and Principles</h3>
                <p>Several fundamental assumptions underpin social science methodology. First, human behavior, while complex, exhibits regularities that can be studied systematically. Second, social phenomena can be understood through careful observation and analysis, even when controlled experimentation proves difficult or impossible. Third, social reality exists both objectively through observable actions and subjectively through individual experiences and interpretations.</p>
                <p>The scientific method in social science adapts to accommodate human complexity. Researchers employ various approaches including quantitative analysis, qualitative investigation, and mixed methods to capture different dimensions of social reality. This methodological diversity reflects the recognition that human behavior operates across multiple levels simultaneously.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>The Challenge of Studying Human Systems</h3>
                <p>Social science confronts unique challenges that distinguish it from natural sciences. Human beings possess consciousness, intentionality, and the capacity for reflexivity, meaning they can change their behavior based on their understanding of research findings. This creates a dynamic relationship between knowledge and its subject matter that does not exist in physics or chemistry.</p>
                <p>Additionally, social phenomena involve emergent properties that arise from collective behavior but cannot be reduced to individual actions alone. Markets, cultures, and political systems exhibit characteristics that transcend the sum of their individual components, requiring analytical frameworks that can accommodate both micro and macro levels of analysis.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Evidence and Validation</h3>
                <p>Social science establishes validity through multiple forms of evidence. Quantitative approaches rely on statistical analysis, surveys, and experimental designs to identify patterns and relationships. Qualitative methods use interviews, ethnography, and case studies to understand meaning and context. The convergence of findings across different methodologies strengthens confidence in social scientific conclusions.</p>
                <p>Replication and peer review serve as quality control mechanisms, though the context-dependent nature of many social phenomena makes exact replication challenging. Instead, social science often relies on conceptual replication, where similar patterns emerge across different settings and populations.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Practical Applications and Limitations</h3>
                <p>Social science generates knowledge that informs policy decisions, organizational management, and individual choices. Economic models guide fiscal policy, psychological research influences educational practices, and sociological insights shape urban planning. However, the predictive power of social science remains limited compared to natural sciences due to the inherent complexity and variability of human systems.</p>
                <p>The field acknowledges these limitations while continuing to refine its methods and theoretical frameworks. Social science provides probabilistic rather than deterministic explanations, offering insights into likely outcomes rather than certain predictions.</p>
                <p>Through this first principles analysis, social science emerges as a rigorous yet adaptive field that applies scientific thinking to understand human societies while recognizing the unique challenges posed by conscious, reflexive subjects operating within complex, evolving systems.</p>

                <h3 id="l3A">Introduction to Computer System</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A computer system consists of hardware components that have been carefully chosen so that they work well together and software components or programs that run in the computer.</li>
                    <li>The main software component is itself an operating system (OS) that manages and provides services to other programs that can be run in the computer.</li>
                    <li>In its most basic form, a computer system is a programmable electronic device that can accept input; store data; and retrieve, process and output information.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <h3>Evolution of computer systems</h3>
                <p>Computers are programmable electronic devices that can process data. To comprehend what a computer system is, it's important to analyze the history and evolution of computer system development over the years.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Early models</h3>
                <p>The history of computer systems goes way back to Charles Babbage's differential machines. Despite never being completed, this machine is considered the first example of a computing system. It came before the early 20th-century mainframes and large computers. The Von Neumann machine and others of its kind were later used as the first massive, monolithic computers in the human world.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>The personal computer</h3>
                <p>The microprocessor revolution of the 1970s and 1980s saw the introduction of personal computers, also known as desktop computers. The first true home computer that came with a monitor display was released to the public in 1977. At the time, many large organizations used expensive and massive computers. The personal computer employed a computer box as its main piece of hardware, together with peripheral devices such as a mouse and keyboard and computer software that was downloaded into floppy disks.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Operating system</h3>
                <p>The operating system was initially created to support a complete computer system in a box and to provide users with a common interface for using the software that operated on that hardware. Additionally, the actual software components to execute on a specific operating system, such as files, apps and executables, were also introduced. The first IBM PC, officially known as the IBM Model 5150, ran Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system and had an Intel 8088 processor running at 4.77 MHz.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Laptops</h3>
                <p>The laptops emerged as hardware became smaller and more portable over time. The Portal, the first authorized portable microcomputer, debuted in 1980. It was built using an 8-bit, 2 MHz Intel 8085 processor and was equipped with a 64K byte random access memory (RAM).</p>
                <br>

                <h3>The Cloud</h3>
                <p>The introduction of the modern cloud in the early 2000s revolutionized software distribution and data storage. The out-of-the-box software strategy was rendered obsolete in the enterprise IT sector as software was provided digitally through the internet in place of physical media, such as floppy disks and compact disks.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Virtualization</h3>
                <p>The concept of hardware and software configurations has recently undergone a radical change thanks to virtualization. Instead of using physical hardware, the majority of current computing systems use virtualized computer systems. Through the use of virtualization, a single computer's hardware resources can be split up into several virtual machines.</p>
                <br>

                <h3 id="l3B">Components of a computer system</h3>
                <p>The components of a computer system are typically divided into hardware and software parts, which are both essential in making a computer system functional.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Hardware components</h3>
                <p>The hardware components include the computer itself; the physical parts inside the computer, such as a circuit board and storage devices; and any peripherals attached to the computer. These components can be either classified as input devices, such as a mouse or keyboard, or output devices, such as a monitor or a printer. While output devices reflect or display user data, input devices are designed to accept user data.</p>

                <br>

                <h3>Software components</h3>
                <p>Software components are the set of instructions that are stored and run on the computer hardware. The software controls how a computer system works. It can be grouped into the following two categories:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>System software. Programs that are needed for the computer to function, including the OS, utilities software, programming language translators and library routines.</li>
                    <li>Application Software. Programs that let a user perform particular tasks, including word processing, database management, spreadsheet calculations, web browsing, gaming, programming and graphic design. Additionally, it may also include specific programs such as accounts, payroll and air traffic control.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="l3C">Types of computer systems</h3>
                <p>Depending on the applications and performance requirements, numerous computer system types are utilized in various fields. Computers are typically divided into two groups based on their size and their capacity for handling data.</p>
                <p>The following are computer system types based on their size:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Microcomputers. These are commonly used for personal computing purposes. They carry a single processor for their CPU and a microprocessor that controls it. Examples of microcomputers include laptops, tablets, mobile phones and personal digital assistants.</li>
                    <li>Minicomputers. These computers were created in the middle of the 1960s and the early minicomputers replaced vacuum tubes with transistors. They have a larger storage capacity and faster computing power than microcomputers and are capable of supporting hundreds of users simultaneously. Devices such as the Apple iPad, iPod and Samsung Tab are examples of minicomputers.</li>
                    <li>Medium-sized computers. Compared to both microcomputers and minicomputers, these computer systems offer faster speeds and a larger storage space. These computers have numerous disk drives that can be utilized to process online access requests as well as a sizable number of high-speed input-output devices. Common example of a medium-sized computer includes IBM's Power Systems.</li>
                    <li>Mainframe computers. Large, multi-user mainframe computers can access billions of pieces of data and are capable of processing millions of instructions each second. With little operator input, mainframes can support multiple computer programs and hundreds of thousands of users at the same time. The banking and telecom sectors are a good candidate for mainframe computers as they process data in large quantities.</li>
                    <li>Supercomputers. These computers are enormous in size and extremely powerful. They're specifically designed to handle huge amounts of data. They're capable of executing hundreds of millions of instructions every second. Supercomputers are typically used for calculation-intensive tasks such as molecular modeling, climate research, weather forecasting, quantum physics and physical stimulations.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>

                <p>The following are computer system types based on their data handling capacity:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Analog computer. This type of computer system continuously processes varying data. Without translating it first into numbers and codes, it can simply accept the data from the equipment of measurement. It gauges the constant variations in physical quantities, and a reading on a dial or scale serves as the output. A speedometer or a mercury thermometer are examples of analog computers.</li>
                    <li>Digital computer. Digital computers effortlessly calculate algorithms and logical processes at rapid speeds. They use stored programs in their memory to process raw data as an input and then output the result. Since they can only understand binary inputs, these computers convert the raw input data to 0 and 1, after which the data is processed to create the result. Digital computers include all current models of desktops, laptops, and cellphones.</li>
                    <li>Hybrid computer. This computer is a combination of both analog and digital computers. Hybrid computers combine the speed of an analog computer with the accuracy and memory of a digital computer. As a result, they can handle both continuous and discrete data. Hybrid computers convert analog signals into digital signals for use when processing input data after accepting analog signals as input. </li>
                </ol>

                <h3 id="l4A">Introduction to Number System</h3>
                <p>Number System is a method of representing numbers with the help of a set of symbols and rules; it is a mathematical notation used to represent quantities or values in various forms.</p>
                <p><em>Please remember every piece of data in a computer—whether it's text, images, sound, video, code, or memory addresses—is ultimately stored as binary, a string of 0s and 1s making numbers and number systems the core of computing.</em></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Humans understand decimal, and computers understand binary, so we have two different number systems.</li>
                    <li>Binary can be long for large amount of data, so there are more systems like octal and hexadecimal that allow binary sequence to be broken into groups making it less error-prone and readable compared to binary.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="center-image">

                    <p>Fig: 1 Everything is stored in the computer in the form of binary.</p>
                </div>
                <p>As shown in Figure 1, binary is the foundation of all data representation in computers. Let's now explore the different number systems that enable this process.</p>
                <p>Number systems provide a structured way to represent numbers, enabling arithmetic operations and ensuring consistent, understandable notation.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A number system uses a base (or radix) to represent values.</li>
                    <li>The base refers to the number of unique digits, including zero, that a system uses to represent numbers.</li>
                    <li>Each system has its own set of rules for representing.</li>
                </ul>
