                <br>
                <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
                <p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Discuss the history that led to the creation of computer science as a field</li>
                    <li>Define computer science</li>
                    <li>Assess what computer science can do, as well as what it should not do</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <p>The field of computer science (CS) is the study of computing, which includes all phenomena related to computers, such as the Internet. With foundations in engineering and mathematics, computer science focuses on studying algorithms. An algorithm is a sequence of precise instructions that enables computing. This includes components computers use to process information. By studying and applying algorithms, computer science creates applications and solutions that impact all areas of society. For example, computer science developed the programs that enable online shopping, texting with friends, streaming music, and other technological processes.</p>
                <p>While computers are common today, they weren't always this pervasive. For those whose lives have been shaped by computer technology, it can sometimes seem like computer technology is ahistorical: computing often focuses on rapid innovation and improvement, wasting no time looking back and reflecting on the past. Yet the foundations of computer science defined over 50, and as much as 100, years ago very much shape what is possible with computing today.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>The Early History of Computing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first computing devices were not at all like the computers we know today. They were physical calculation devices such as the abacus, which first appeared in many societies across the world thousands of years ago. They allowed people to tally, count, or add numbers (Figure 1.2). Today, abaci are still used in some situations, such as helping small children learn basic arithmetic, keeping score in games, and as a calculating tool for people with visual impairments. However, abaci are not common today because of the invention of number systems such as the Arabic number system (0, 1, 2, 3, . . .), which included zero and place values that cannot be computed with abaci. The concept of an algorithm was also invented around this time. Algorithms use inputs and a finite number of steps to carry out arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and produce outputs used in computing. Today’s computers still rely on the same foundations of numbers, calculations, and algorithms, except at the scale of billions of numbers and billions of calculations per second.</li>
                    <li>To introduce a concrete example of an algorithm, let us consider binary search algorithm, which is used to locate a number in a sorted array of integers efficiently. The algorithm operates by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half to perform the search. If the number being searched is less than the integer in the middle of the interval, the interval is narrowed to the lower half. In the alternative, the interval is narrowed to the upper half. The algorithm repeatedly checks until the number is found or the interval is empty.</li>
                    <li>Algorithms may sound complicated, but they can be quite simple. For example, recipes to prepare food are algorithms with precise directions for ingredient amounts, the process to combine these, and the temperatures and cooking methods needed to transform the combined ingredients into a specific dish. The dish is the output produced by following the algorithm of a recipe.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>The next major development in the evolution of computing occurred in 1614 when John Napier, a Scottish mathematician, developed logarithms, which express exponents by denoting the power that a number must be raised to obtain another value. Logarithms provided a shortcut for making tedious calculations and became the foundation for multiple analog calculating machines invented during the 1600s.</li>

                    <li>Scientists continued to explore different ways to speed up or automate calculations. In the 1820s, English mathematician Charles Babbage invented the Difference Engine with the goal of preventing human errors in manual calculations. The Difference Engine provided a means to automate the calculations of polynomial functions and astronomical calculations.</li>

                    <li>Babbage followed the Difference Engine with his invention of the Analytical Engine. With assistance from Ada Lovelace, the Analytical Engine was program-controlled and included features like an integrated memory and an arithmetic logic unit. Lovelace used punched cards to create sequencing instructions that could be read by the Analytical Engine to automatically perform any calculation included in the programming code. With her work on the Analytical Engine, Lovelace became the world’s first computer programmer.</li>

                    <li>The next major development in computing occurred in the late 1800s when Herman Hollerith, an employee of the U.S. Census Office, developed a machine that could punch cards and count them. In 1890, Hollerith’s invention was used to tabulate and prepare statistics for the U.S. census.</li>

                    <li>By the end of the 1800s and leading into the early 1900s, calculators, adding machines, typewriters, and related machines became more commonplace, setting the stage for the invention of the computer. In the 1940s, multiple computers became available, including IBM’s Harvard Mark 1. These were the forerunners to the advent of the digital computer in the 1950s, which changed everything and evolved into the computers and related technology we have today.</li>

                    <li>Around this time, computer science emerged as an academic discipline rooted in the principles of mathematics, situated primarily in elite institutions, and funded by demand from the military for use in missile guidance systems, airplanes, and other military applications. As computers could execute programs faster than humans, computer science replaced human-powered calculation with computer-powered problem-solving methods. In this way, the earliest academic computer scientists envisioned computer science as a discipline that was far more intellectual and cognitive compared to the manual calculation work that preceded it.</li>

                    <li>Richard Bellman was a significant contributor to this effort. A mathematics professor at Princeton and later at Stanford in the 1940s, Bellman later went to work for the Rand Corporation, where he studied the theory of multistage decision processes. In 1953, Bellman invented dynamic programming,1 which is a mathematical optimization methodology and a technique for computer programming. With dynamic programming, complex problems are divided into more manageable subproblems. Each subproblem is solved, and the results are stored, ultimately resulting in a solution to the overall complex problem.2 With this approach, Bellman helped revolutionize computer programming and enable computer science to become a robust field.</li>
